	<h4>What is the purpose of this study?</h4>
	<p>The aim of this study is to gather information about the health
		behaviours of teenage and young adult cancer survivors. We would like
		to gather information on your views about lifestyle advice, for
		example what advice you have received or would have liked to receive.</p>
	<h4>Why have I been invited?</h4>
	<p>We would like to design some advice on lifestyle (for example
		exercise and diet) that can be given to young people who have had
		cancer. You have been invited to join our study as you are a young
		person between 13 and 24 years of age and have had cancer diagnosis.</p>
	<h4>What will taking part involve?</h4>
	<p>You are invited to complete the ‘Health and Lifestyle
		Questionnaire’. It asks questions about your current health and
		lifestyle and about the advice you received when you were diagnosed
		with cancer. The survey should take around 15-20 minutes to complete.
		At the end of the Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire you will be asked
		if you would like to be contacted about taking part in future focus groups
		aiming to discuss some of the topics contained within the
		questionnaire. You can also complete the survey without leaving your
		contact details.</p>
	<h4>Are there any risks in taking part?</h4>
	<p>There are no risks associated with completing the survey, the
		survey can be completed at any time you choose and you can exit the
		survey and stop at any point.</p>
	<h4>What will the benefits of value of the research be?</h4>
	<p>This information is very important to us as it will help us to
		understand the current lifestyles of young people who have had a
		diagnosis of cancer.</p>
	<p>You will also have the option of entering a prize draw for
		Amazon vouchers if you choose to participate.</p>
	<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
	<p>It is up to you to decide if you take part. If you choose not to
		do so it will not affect your medical care in anyway. You are free to
		withdraw from the study at any time and do not need to give any
		reason.</p>
	<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
	<p>All information we obtain about you will remain confidential.
		All the data collected from this study will be looked at by authorised
		persons from UCL. As participation is anonymous it will not be
		possible for us to withdraw your data once you have completed and
		submitted your questionnaire.</p>
	<h4>What will happen to the results of the study?</h4>
	<p>Results from the study will be published in peer reviewed
		journal articles aimed towards clinical academics and health care
		professionals. Confidentiality and anonymity will be maintained and it
		will not be possible to identify you from any publications.</p>
	<p>
		<strong> All data will be collected and stored in accordance
			with the Data Protection Act 1998.</strong>
