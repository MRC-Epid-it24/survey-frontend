    <h2>Localisation and internationalisation</h2>
    <p>Intake24 offers full support for localisation and internationalisation of both the user interface and the
      food database.</p>
    <p>The user interface supports translation of all labels, prompts and contextual help messages. RTL languages
      such as Arabic are also supported.</p>
    <p>The food database is designed to be very flexible with respect to localisation. Local food databases can be
      made as simple as overriding some foods in another reference local database, or defining a completely different set
      of foods.
  <p>Intake24 provides an online collaborative editing tool for authoring localisations, as well as a complete API
    for automated data upload.</p>

    <h2>Local adaptations and use of the system</h2>

    <p>Intake24 has been widely used in many research projects and has been adapted for use in New Zealand. It is
      also currently being adapted and translated for use in Portugal, Denmark, the UAE and Australia. It has recently
      been field tested in a sample of the Scottish population to gain feedback on the system and identify areas of
      development and is being validated against Doubly-labelled water in a study by University of Cambridge.</p>

    <p>Some of the many research projects that have used (or are currently using) Intake24 to assess dietary intake
      include:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>The BBaRTS Healthy Teeth Behaviour Change Programme for preventing dental caries in primary school
        children: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial - Queen Mary University of London</li>
      <li>Evaluation of the Change4Life Sugar Smart Campaign – Newcastle University</li>
      <li>The FENLAND study - University of Cambridge, MRC Epidemiology Unit</li>
      <li>The NoHow study - EU Horizon 2020 project</li>
      <li>Many PhD and Undergraduate student projects including from; Abertay University, Newcastle University,
        Bristol University and Northumbria University.</li>
    </ul>
