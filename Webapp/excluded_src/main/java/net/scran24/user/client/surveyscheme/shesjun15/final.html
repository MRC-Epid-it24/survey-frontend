	<p>Thank you for completing Intake24!</p>
	<p>
		We value all feedback from users and would like to know what you think of the system. If this is your <strong>final
			day of completion</strong> (day four) please follow the link below to <strong>provide feedback</strong> and we will then send
		you your <strong>£20 Post Office voucher (to exchange for cash at your local Post Office).</strong>
	<p>
		If you haven’t finished the study (completed four days) and are unlikely to complete all four days we would still <strong>really
			value</strong> your feedback. Please click on the link below which will take you to the feedback survey.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">
		We only ask you to submit your feedback once. Please click the feedback link below after you have completed your <span
			style="text-decoration: underline;">last (fourth)</span> food recall. If you have already submitted your feedback
		before you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> do not need to do that again.</span>
