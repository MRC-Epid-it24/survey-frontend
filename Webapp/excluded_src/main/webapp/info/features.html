			<h1>Welcome to Intake24</h1>
			<p>Intake24 is an open source self-completed computerised dietary recall system based on multiple-pass 24-hour
				recall. The online system offers similar data quality to interviewer-led recalls at a significantly lower cost.</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>Intake24 is a self-completed computerised 24-hr dietary recall system. The system was initially developed for
					use with 11-24 year olds.</p>
				<p>The development of the system was an iterative process informed by 4 cycles of user testing. Interviewer-led
					24-hr recalls were conducted at the end of each round of testing to feed into the development of the system by
					identifying commonly missed foods and drinks.</p>
				<p>The system is currently being field tested with participants aged 11 years and over (including older adults).</p>
				<h2>System design</h2>
				<p>The system is based on a multiple pass 24-hr recall and includes placeholders for various meals and snacks.
					These are displayed in chronological order, however, the user can choose to complete them in any order they wish.
					Each meal has a placeholder for drinks separately from foods in order to prompt people to remember this commonly
					forgotten element of intake. Foods are entered as free text in the ‘quick list’ phase of the recall and the user is
					then asked to match each food to a food in the database.</p>

				<p>Custom-designed algorithms ensure that the system deals effectively with the majority of misspelled items.</p>
				<p>All foods in the database are coded to the National Diet and Nutrition Survey Nutrient Databank. Once the
					food type has been selected the user is asked to estimate portion size.</p>

				<h2>Food photographs for estimation of portion size</h2>
				<p>The portion sizes depicted in the tool are based on the portion sizes recorded, for each food, by
					participants in the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys carried out in Great Britain. The default portion shown is
					the median portion and the size can be increased or decreased by clicking on the thumbnails or using the ‘I had
					less’ or ‘I had more’ buttons.</p>

				<h2>Prompts and reminders</h2>
				<p>The system includes an extensive range of prompts for items commonly consumed together, checks for low energy
					reports, missing drinks and long time gaps. A final summary asks the respondent to have a final check for any
					forgotten items before submitting the recall. Additional questions can be included to gather information such as
					the source of each item or meal, whether the TV was on etc. As well as collecting this additional information these
					questions may serve as a further prompt to think through the previous day and remember any items missed from the
					recall.</p>
